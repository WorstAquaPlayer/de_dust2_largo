# de_dust2_largo

Counter-Strike 1.6 custom map. Spin-off of the original de_dust2 map included in CS 1.6, with the added restriction of the players only being able to move through the side passage that connects the T base and CT base.

It is nicknamed since in Argentina we dubbed the "side" passage as "largo". 

Altough the suffix of the map is "de_", actually it is not possible to plant the bomb and the map is of deathmatch type. It only bears the suffix because of, let's say, "marketing" reasons.

This map was developed in the southern-hemisphere summer of 2005 while I was 15 years old. In the repository you can find the compiled .bsp version and also the original sources that I used to create the map.

To get the de_dust2 source, I just decompiled the original de_dust2 map included in CS 1.6 and rebuilt it from scratch, including only the side passage. The original text file included in the distributable version of the map is included below.

## What is each file?

.nav - It's the file that bots used to know how to navigate through a map. It is required for the 1.6 bots to avoid them behaving awkwardly.

.res - Lists the resources required by the game to be able to download all the map dependencies when downloading the map from a server when you don't have it in your computer.

.bsp - Compiled map. Ready to run in CS 1.6

.rmf - Source of the map. Can be opened with Valve Hammer Editor 3.5. It requires importing the Half-Life 1.1.1.0 textures (halflife.wad) and de_dust2 textures (de_dust2.wad)

.txt - Info file.
